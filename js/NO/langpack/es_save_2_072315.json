This part of the project includes musical and non-musical performances that use the choreographies and protocols of national ceremonies as a key art material and source of inspiration. Publications, websites, social media platforms, mapping interfaces, blogs and feeds, forums and digital networks, as well as databases on flags and anthems are also understood to be part of these social and institutional interventions.":"XXXXXXXXXXXX",

		"Each piece in the series combines four national anthems, arranged for four voices (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass). Each voice is assigned one of the national anthems. The countries' groups of four are determined by their English alphabetical order, as found in the 2001 World Almanac and Book of Facts. The language that each anthem is sung in, however, shifts to that of the country that follows it in the Almanac. So, for example, the United States anthem is sung in Spanish, the official language of Uruguay.

		"Its social interventions, visual compositions, flag displays, and musical performances allow the audience to understand other national anthems in their native language for the first time, while their own anthem becomes incomprehensible. For those speaking several languages, or having strong associations with more than one anthem, the experience is even more layered and representative of today's cultural pluralism. These works incorporate a classical voice recital, yet placing it with the paradoxical establishment of anti-art. The recital is not simply intended to be 'musical' but is rather nurtured by the experimental attitude of avant-garde groups from various decades and regions, as well as their conceptually structured approaches. Channeling the intense emotional and cultural associations we have towards anthems, the premiere performance of these compositions at The Phillips will also invite discussions around the notions of independence, colonialism, (multi)nationalism, migrations, and mapping, all so deeply related to the history of nations and cultures. Other works in the series include video, visual scores, paintings, and various media associated with socially engaged art.":"XXXXXXXXXXXX",

The CAEP enthusiastically accepted the proposal and recommended it to the government of Mexico City.

The series as a whole, with its play of transparencies and reflections, makes impossible any separation between past-present, artwork-viewer-environment, or the pre- and post-Columbian. Coatlicue and Las Meninas, however, is the most iconic demonstration of the modernity/coloniality union. The work proposes two temporary installations. The first would bring the Aztec sculpture Coatlicue to the Museo del Prado in Madrid to display it in front of Las Meninas by Velázquez. The second would transport Las Meninas to Mexico City to be displayed in front of the Coatlicue at its habitual home, the National Museum of Anthropology. Both installations would include a large sheet of dark glass hovering between the works, integrating again--through transparencies and reflections--the artworks, their viewers, and their contexts. Not to be confused with the modern notion of mestizaje, these reflections allow the perception of simultaneous difference, copresence, and cotemporality.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",

Lasch selected sixteen figures from the museum’s permanent collection of pre-Columbian art, and placed them on sculpture pedestals with their backs turned to the viewer. In front of the figures hung large, rectangular black mirrors, reflecting the fronts of the sculptures. After prolonged viewing, ghostly images of Spanish baroque paintings emerged from behind the dark sheets of glass. Standing amidst Lasch’s installation, the viewer saw indigenous art, colonial representation, and his or her own face and body collapsed onto a single mirrored plane.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"This book is both a catalogue of the installation and an independent work of art. Including full color reproductions of thirty-nine photographs taken of the installation, and the texts Lasch wrote to accompany it, Black Mirror/Espejo Negro draws out the relevance of this work to contemporary photography as much as installation art and conceptualism. Critical essays written by Srinivas Aravamudan, Jennifer A. González, Arnaud Maillet, Walter Mignolo, and Pete Sigal reflect on Lasch’s work in relation to current debates in contemporary art, race discourse, pre-Colombian studies, postcolonial theory and decolonial thought.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",

		"Produced specifically for the MUAC in Mexico City and incorporating pre-Colombian works from the UNAM’s own collection, Indigenous Spectrum is a new large scale museum installation from Pedro Lasch’s Black Mirror/Espejo Negro series. The first installation in the series focused on coloniality at large and was commissioned by the Nasher Museum of Art to accompany its blockbuster exhibition El Greco to Velazquez. Lasch selected sixteen figures from the museum’s permanent collection of pre-Columbian art, and placed them on sculpture pedestals with their backs turned to the viewer. In front of the figures hung large, rectangular black mirrors, reflecting the fronts of the sculptures. After prolonged viewing, ghostly images of Spanish baroque paintings emerged from behind the dark sheets of glass. Standing amidst Lasch’s installation, the viewer saw indigenous art, colonial representation, and his or her own face and body collapsed onto a single mirrored plane.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"The new installation created for MUAC’s Color Theory exhibition employs a similar play of physical and psychological reflections, but the new pairings intentionally exclude any representation from the Spanish colonial period. The nine chosen objects from Totonaca and other pre-Colombian civilizations are here all masks that face protraits and racial representations of indigeneity from Mexico’s postcolonial repertoire. These darkened postcolonial spectres and their reflected pre-Colombian masks stare back at the viewer through the black mirror, incorporating the present moment through its reflection. Covering a broad historical period (1810-present) and a wide range of representations (from the non-racial to the racist), these spectres include XIX Century ethnographic plates, the India Bonita pageant winner from the 1920s Universal Ilustrado, Diego Rivera’s fresco depiction of Tomás Mejía, the cinematic icon of Tizoc from Mexico’s Golden Era, the heroic Indians of Chucho Helguera, La India María’s most recent appearance as a telenovela character, and the intentionally opaque figure of Comandanta Ramona in her ski-mask. The spectres also expose the role particular media have played in the production and reproduction of what we consider to be Indigenous. Employing both modernist self-reflexivity and contemporary social art practice, these black mirrors make museum visitor’s bodies an unavoidable part of the artwork, therefore also bringing in all the racial associations such viewers may carry with them, be it by their own desire or society’s power of projection. An endless number of ephemeral portraits will thus be created as the MUAC’s visitors see their faces in each black mirror.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",

		"Experimental opera, text by Elias Canetti, music by Matthias Hinke, set and costume design by Pedro Lasch": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"This work included the first iteration of the mirror masks, originally designed as theatrical props for specific characters in the opera. While the visuals and music were completed, the opera was never presented to the public. Neither were the mirror masks until 2002, when they were radically reenvisioned as works to exist in everyday life.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Interaction Ritual": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Dialogues, intimate conversations, and small group interactions with use of mirror masks, duration variable (ongoing)": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		
		"Paradoxically, the most public use of these mirror masks has also been its most intimate. Over the many years, they have been worn first and foremost in the context of the everyday. Hundreds of conversations, café gatherings, parties, security checkpoints, and other such small group settings with or without a specific agenda have added up to constitute an unlikely mass medium, this one being non-linear, multi-vocal, and decentralized. It is in this highly adaptable and intimate context that the work shows its closest links to network society and radical pedagogy. Just like a teacher who hates mass gatherings may cherish deep conversations with thousands of students - if we account for a life of teaching, it is this ‘interaction ritual’ that may account for Naturalization’s most significant social and perceptual intervention.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"The Dance of Mirrors": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Digital video, color, sound. Duration 3min, Edition of 12 (DVD), Collection of Gilberto Cárdenas Collection (#3 of 12)": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"This artwork documents an experimental dance with over sixty children wearing mirror-masks that happened in 2002 in Queens, NY. Staged as part of the experimental program ‘Art, Story-Telling, and the Five Senses’ that Lasch founded and directed between 2000 and 2005, the video has a soundtrack co-produced by the children. The centrality of folkloric ballet in immigrant communities is here fused with processes inspired by figures as wide as John Cage, Lygia Clark, Subcomandante Marcos, and Helio Oiticica. The result resembles a sci-fi, avant-garde folkloric ballet. The event was produced in collaboration with: Ballet Teopochtli, Encontrando Nuestras Raíces Afterschool Program, Mexicanos Unidos de Queens, and Asociación Tepeyac de New York, with additional support from Dedalus Foundation and a special performance by Ricardo Dominguez.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",

		"The journalistic images that appear in this work have been significantly altered by the artist to open an internal dialogue between seemingly disparate areas of the contemporary world stage. The original photographs all share a common icon: human defacement. Indigenous zapatistas wearing black ski-masks in southern Mexico, women wearing blue burqas in Kabul or black abayas in Saudi Arabia, Iraqi torture victims wearing green or black hoods at Abu Ghraib, Michael Jackson wearing a mask in Russia, and black bloc members covering their face in Seattle, are but a few examples of the refusal of the face which has become the paradoxical icon of our generation.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"The Mechanism of Facial Expression": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Projection, photographic installation, and masks for public use": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"This installation presents an abstract scientific narrative with slide projections, or alternately, a photographic installation of adaptable scale. In both cases, the mirror masks provided for public use here split the users’ face into six distinct areas of transparency and reflection, creating complex spatial and psychological rhythms as visitors move through the building with the masks. Devised as a critical homage to the 1864 publication of Dr. Duchenne de Bolougne’s studies on ‘the mechanism of human facial emotion,’ this installation was first produced for the extraordinary setting of medical history displays at the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia, for an exhibition of contemporary art curated there by Tanya Leighton.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Point-Counterpoint-Fusion (Homage to Daniel Buren)": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"C-print installation and mirror masks for public use": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"This work deals with the various forms of identification we experience in our daily encounters: the sound of our names in relation to each other and what we associate with them, how our bodies measure up against one another, our nationalities, our age, gender, and the color of our skin. One crucial mechanism of the work is that our own identity is always dependent and relative to that of others. The musical analogy of the title refers to the fluctuating heights of the masks and their viewers (point - counterpoint), as well as the desires and anxieties experienced by the confusion of identity generated by the mask (fusion). The striped mask is a direct reference to French artist Daniel Buren’s decades long exploration of the social and physical structures around the production, perception and distribution of art, but they also contain a darker set of ideas related to some societies’ imposition of a uniform standard to measure us all. The history of phrenology, census categories, racialized notions of beauty and intelligence, and even the fashion and cosmetics industry, can all be seen to participate in this often violent history.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",

		"(Parts 1 & 2)": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Part 1: Oil paintings for wall and floor, mirror masks and reproduction of Edouard Manet’s The Execution of Emperor Maximilian, 1867 (Städtische Kunsthalle, Mannheim). Part 2: Oil painting on wood and drawing on paper.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Museum visitors are here encouraged to reenact The Execution of Maximilian by wearing the masks provided on the wall boards, and standing on the platforms on the floor. Instead of using rifles as is done by their models, visitors are invited to shoot with their cameras, creating multi-perspective renditions of the famous painting. The reenactment can also be done with fewer than ten people. Two preparatory drawings and a painting showing the patterns that result from the view of figure #3 (Tomás Mejía in Manet’s painting) constitute part 2 of the project. Manet’s orginally banned masterwork is again placed at the center of anti-colonial struggles, just as its reincarnation in the present foregrounds the ongoing relevance of political executions as a form of spectacle. During its first public viewing in New York for Lasch’s Queens Museum solo exhibition, for example, this topic highly resonated with webcast beheadings of journalists and other intentionally spectacular executions, staged in Fallujah and other places by those fighting against the US-led invasion and occupation of Iraq. Only a few months later, we would all witness the global broadcasting of Saddam Hussein’s unlikely death ‘by hanging.’": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Statements on Masks": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Installation and optional performance (ongoing)": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"This piece consists of an installation and optional live bilingual art action. The installation presents the objects used during the art action, inviting participants to inhabit a space that merges the classroom, the TV show room, and the temple. Statements are read in one language by the person behind the table, and another language by the public facing him or her. The statements have been written in relation to the practice of masking or the notion of what we call ‘natural.’ One mask is worn by the person behind the table, while the other one circulates to a new member of the public at the reading of each new statement.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",

		"Box on wheels with 12 mirror masks of various designs, including sample instructions sheet. Collection of Gilberto Cárdenas (#3 of 6)": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Designed for project participants, teachers, collectors, and the artist himself in his ongoing ‘Naturalizations’ workshops, these boxes allow for the easy transportation of mirror masks for slightly larger activities and installations. In some cases, they have also been used by groups and individuals through a special ‘check out’ system, much like a book may be borrowed from a library.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",	
		"Can You Rephrase That in the Form of a Question": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"This site specific choreography was created by Mark Dendy for the Durham Performing Arts Center in the context of the 2009 American Dance Festival.

		"The images presented here are documents and artworks related to a series of workshops in Port-Au-Prince, Haiti in the context of the first edition of The Ghetto Biennale (2009). Created in collaboration with Esther Gabara, the workshops and their related photoessay also address the unspeakable loss experienced by friends and collaborators in Haiti only a few weeks later, during the tragic earthquake of 2010 and its lingering aftermath.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Vertical Flâneur": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Site-specific workshop for 2 London Eye rotations (60mins), consecutive installation, dimensions variable": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Produced for Hayward Gallery’s ‘Wide Open School’ exhibition, and held on board of a capsule of the London Eye, this experimental workshop on non-linear space and time combined live aerial views from the London Eye with the use of optical and perceptual devices. Also addressed was London’s historical role - as the heart of a naval empire, and the place that set the global clock by Greenwich Mean Time - as the leading manufacturer and exporter of rational, linear time. As this workshop unfolded during the Eye's ascent and descent, consideration of key London landmarks in the history of time were contrasted with a collective experiment against the temporal linearity they have instilled.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Naturalizations: Questions, Statements, and Propositions": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Short, fragmentary writings for collective inquiry": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"The intentionally non-linear and fragmentary writing process of these texts has been developed over the years for the many workshops, events, installations, and actions that are part of the Naturalizations series. Depending on the context, selections of these may appear on walls, in publications, engraved on the mirror masks themselves, or simply exchanged verbally by a group of participants. The order in which they appear has no relationship to chronology, hierarchy, importance, or subject matter.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",

		"What forms of government rely most heavily on the power of visual and linguistic abstraction?": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",

		"Why does it seem startling, absurd, or even offensive, to copy a painting by Jackson Pollock or Mark Rothko, when we are faced everyday with their endless repetition?": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Where exactly are the borders between the historical, the modern, and the contemporary? How porous or rigid are they? May we use these mirror masks as tools for creative border crossing?": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Must all dialogue be premised on mutual acknowledgment and recognition, or may some forms of it benefit from an intentional mutual erasure? What social and physical conditions allow for such temporary suspensions of our ego?": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"What are ideal tools and methods for the social transformation of our public cultural institutions, be it for aesthetic or political purposes?": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"How do we explain the fact that so many of the most radical manifestations of contemporary art are produced and incubated within education and public program departments?

		"Undocumented mass migration is a war that happened, and continues to happen, without the middle and upper classes even noticing. With armed resistance struggles these classes are at least forced to pay attention, but without that, and without the power of remittances, migrants would be as ignored and vulnerable in their home countries today, as they were when they were first forced to leave.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Having multiple passports and speaking several languages has never been a problem for the cosmopolitan elites. Multilingualism and multiculturalism only become a problem when they apply to a transnational working class.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"The mirror mask deflects all gazes from its user. In a perverse sense, this is much like whiteness remains invisible and unaccountable for in the global production of gendered and racialized minorities. Women and colored people may find temporary relief in the mask’s reflections, and even use them as a tool for solidarity. But at the end of the day we must strip white culture of its mask, call it by its name, and point to it as the powerfully entrenched minority that it is.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Goethe once referred to symmetry as the aesthetics of fools. Even when they incorporate processes of reproduction, modern and contemporary art practices have likewise assumed a pejorative, dismissive, or ironic stance toward the power of replicas and direct copying.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"Roland Barthes proposed a new art of listening that would supplant the modes of listening of the disciple, the patient, and the believer. If we want to create an analogous revolution of the act of seeing, we must identify and supplant the hierarchical ways of seeing that connect our bodies with the current world picture.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"“Naturalizations” is a work in progress based on the production and distribution of a set of masks, which are used in specific social situations. The masks are rectangular mirrors with slits in the eye and mouth area, and velcro suspenders, which enable the users to move around freely while wearing them. Over the years, the series has included interventions in public spaces, schools, grassroots settings, university seminars, publications, museum installations, as well as artworks in traditional media such as photography, painting, sculpture, dance, and theater. Taking place in many cities and countries around the world, Naturalizations projects have included hundreds of participants and dozens of partnering institutions.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"The initial perception created by these masks is one of spatial and psychological confusion. Subjects are reversed if only one person is wearing the mask. If several people wear them and look at each other, their faces disappear and transform into an endless set of reflections of other mirrors, other faces, environments, and objects. Landscape and subject are one and many. Architecture merges with the body. Subjects are inseparable from each other, their bodies dismembered by rectangular planes departing and arriving through reflected gazes. Light breaks and travels on these masks with unpredictable speed and variety. Space and movement become counter-intuitive.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"The masks force us to adapt to a new physical reality, one which denies what has become “natural.” The substitution of the facial marker of individuality for a sign of constant change and reflection results in the erasure of one kind of subjectivity, only to formulate a new set of social conditions. The hierarchical address of the observer, the photographer, and the interviewer is turned upon itself. The space behind the camera is made visible. A dancing group wearing the masks decides to perform for its own pleasure, or for the reflection of their audience. The daily balance between extroverted and introverted actions becomes a tangible visual rhythm. The mask is the new stage, framed by the theater of the everyday.": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"The temporary opening of these spatial constructions where viewers and authors are free to switch places, may also reflect on the merit of collective efforts and the fallacy of ontology. The process and title of the series “Naturalizations” also invites to constantly question “the natural” and those institutions - religious, mythological or governmental, which claim not only to know what is “natural,” but are even ready to issue their own stamps of “naturalization.”": "XXXXXXXXXXXX",
